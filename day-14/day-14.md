# Delete Delete Delete
Welcome to **day 13** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Delving further into the running tracker today, and implementing a feature to allow users to delete a run. Maybe it was entered incorrectly, maybe you just can't handle the guilt that you called a walk a run in the tracker, either way, you can now delete a run (and then enter it back in again later).

Because I wanted to challenge myself more, I didn't like giving users an index that started at 0 in order to pick a run to delete, it's fine for techie's but not for everyday Joe, so once I got past that hurdle, we were pretty smooth sailing on this one. I didn't get around to checking that the input for the ID to delete was one of the ones shown on screen, but have put that as a todo for later on.

Happy running.
