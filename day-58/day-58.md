#  More Tidying
Welcome to **day 58** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Another day of tidying up for me today. I started with a bunch of package updates, including next.js just to bring things up to speed.

I then decided to tackle the new timetable form. I definitely enjoyed the learning and practice of putting together the new timetable form with showing/hiding it upon the button click, but it was out of step with the form used for a new timetable block, and I decided it was much cleaner to replicate that, rather than have 2 different looking forms, or both being hidden/shown forms. To be honest most of the work was just making sure that I was replicating things the same, it did help that I used the default component styling from shadcn for most things, so not too much to tweak, but just getting the spacing the same etc. was important to make it look a bit more polished.

And that's it, nothing too flash today, more tomorrow!

> For this timetable project I won't be copying the whole codebase into this repo every time I work on it, instead I'll just [link to the repo](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app) and even link [direct to the commit here](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app/commit/7628617002a742369e779ad6af375391664afe59) if someone wants to go have a look at that point in time.
