# You Can't Win Them All
Welcome to **day 26** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

>-- Me, Today

Today I wanted to focus on getting the functionality up and running behind the form I built yesterday for adding a new block. I got the main function written, all ready to go, set the form up to trigger it and... nothing.

A fair bit of googling and looking into it, I think it's because I'm trying to do it in a dialog instead of in a form on the page itself, so the form isn't actually sending the data back to the initial page, but it's a little past me at this minute and it's past time for bed, so it's going to have to be a challenge for another day. I think I can write a callback function for it, but I need to work out how to do that. I could also just do away with the fancy dialog box and redirect to a form page specifically for this, I'll see how I feel tomorrow about those choices.

Anyway, still progress, the backend logic is there, just not a complete success today. Tomorrow is another day.
