#  Highlights
Welcome to **day 43** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Just a little update today, not a lot of time, but this is something I've wanted to start looking at for a while. I want the timetable page to be a little more helpful to show the plan for the day, so I want to highlight today vs the other days.

I need some more time to work on getting the background to change, but I've got the day name highlighting in a different colour now, as well as any timetable blocks for the day.

Longer term, I'll also look at putting in either a line to highlight the time of day against the timetable, or highlight the current active block (if there is one).

All work for another day.

> [!NOTE]
> For this timetable project I won't be copying the whole codebase into this repo every time I work on it, instead I'll just [link to the repo](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app) and even link [direct to the commit here](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app/commit/349beca22b9a388807bc9f3f3bfb868c0446610f) if someone wants to go have a look at that point in time.
