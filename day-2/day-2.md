# Welcome 
Welcome to **day 2** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Advancing a bit on yesterday - Get flight booking options.
Using python and [Flight Fare Search](https://rapidapi.com/farish978/api/flight-fare-search). I found the API via [Free API's](https://free-apis.github.io/#/)

To replicate, create a .env file with a RAPIDAPI_KEY which you can get from signing up for free with [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/).
This one had a few more challenges around getting all the info from the user (I know I could do more for validation of the user input). I mostly focussed around sorting and extracting the JSON output, not something I've messed around with too much in the past.

Just like day 1, it runs in the command line for now, another potential candidate for a gui in the future.
