# Log It
Welcome to **day 7** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

So I decided today that I quite like the running tracker, and I can see myself putting a bit more work into this over the course of the next few weeks. So it was an opportunity for me to move away from print statements for logging and use the built in logging library. I also thought I should add a versioning table to the DB so that if I make changes I can deal with those a bit more gracefully, so that's done too.

At some point I guess I should break out some of the modules and functionality into other files, but that's a job for another day

To make this work from a git perspective etc. I've created a separate folder for that little app and will do the work in there, and the copy it into the daily folder to keep track of what was done each day as well. Might not work for everyone, but works for me at the moment.
