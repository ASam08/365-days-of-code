#  Auth Time - Part 11
Welcome to **day 56** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

It's done, it's out, auth is in! It's not perfect, but it's there...

There are some things to do:
- Hide the signout button when auth is disabled
- Either enable the OAuth options or remove them form the signin form
- Redirect the signin page to the dashboard when auth is disabled

But otherwise, I merged the branch and it is done, I think it's almost ready for a v0.1 release, I just want to tidy up those parts mentioned above and work out a better way to enable the users when they need to be manually approved, and I'll be there.

Anyway, more tomorrow!
