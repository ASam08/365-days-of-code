> For this timetable project I won't be copying the whole codebase into this repo every time I work on it, instead I'll just [link to the repo](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app) and even link [direct to the commit here](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app/commit/2995da43399545b811d8490c70428d4a536d7dd5) if someone wants to go have a look at that point in time.
