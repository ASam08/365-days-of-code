# Automate It
Welcome to **day 27** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

27 days. That's how long it took for me to decide I'd had enough of manually creating the folder for each day and this markdown file. Some people will probably say that nearly 4 weeks is probably too long, it's about 1/13<sup>th</sup> of the full year.

Anyway, writing this powershell script was a bit of a break from the timetable app today for me, I don't want it to get too all consuming or become a chore, so good to take a day off of it, while doing something that has really been on my mind for a week or two.

> [!NOTE]
> A quick sidenote, I've copied the script and the templates into this day-27 folder for the upload, but you'll see they actually sit in the parent folder and that's where I'll run them from, as evidenced by the file paths used in the script. There's no way I'll open day-27 every day to run this, so it might as well live in the root.

Looking back at these daily write-ups, you'll notice that the timetable app ones have a bit of a familiar format at the end, so I also added templating for that and a y/n choice to decide whether or not to add it, one less thing for me to copy over.

I might look at extending this to get user input for the title and then add it to the README, but I don't always have the titles in my head when I start so... something to think about.

Anyway, that's all for today folks.
