#  Timetable Tidy Up
Welcome to **day 59** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Today was a bit of a big day, I settled on a license for the project (Apache 2.0), did some more package updates, pushed my first release (v0.1.0) and then settled into trying to tidy up the timetable page.

I've noticed that with the timetable blocks, if they are too short then they end up all distorted and unreadable, so I'm looking to change that up.

First, I've made it so that if it's pretty short, it drops off the end time and room name, then if it's even shorter, it drops off the start time. I'm having a few challenges with getting the subject to centre veritcally in the block, so something for me to carry on working on tomorrow no doubt.

> [!NOTE]
> For this timetable project I won't be copying the whole codebase into this repo every time I work on it, instead I'll just [link to the repo](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app) and even link [direct to the commit here](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app/commit/b18292f4eef5d218cd9e44aa09edcd5fe61e9d36) if someone wants to go have a look at that point in time.
