# Next.js - Part 3
Welcome to **day 17** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Unfortunately I've been hit with a bit of sickness the last couple of days, so not a whole lot of focus on code, but I did still work through a couple more of the lessons in the Next.js [app router tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app), mostly around data mutation, search and pagination. The more I do, the more I'm realising how powerful the framework is, it's a little bit daunting thinking of trying to write something of my own from scratch, but baby steps, little and often will be the approach for sure.

Anyway, that's enough for today, more tomorrow.
