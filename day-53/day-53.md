#  Auth Time - Day 8
Welcome to **day 53** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Ok, today feels like a real winner. The auth is working! Signup, signin and sign out are all live.

There are still a few things to tidy up, like the validation messages aren't showing how I would like, or some sort of response to the user that their signup is successful, or redirecting straight to signin after a successful signup, but the fundamentals are there and I'm pretty happy with that.

A bit more work, maybe tomorrow, on the things above, and a few more, and then it will be ready to PR into the main branch. It feels like a pretty big achievement, especially after over a week working on it.

Anyway, more tomorrow!
