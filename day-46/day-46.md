#  Auth Time - Part 1
Welcome to **day 46** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Ok, it's finally time to look at auth, it's a bit of a beast so it will be a slow burner I think, but it's good to do it and get the experience.

Anyway, not too much to talk about today, I put together the ui for the login page, and started to work my way through implementing it using nextauth. It seems that doing this using nextjs app router is a bit painful, so it might be a frustrating experience, but I'll take it one step at a time.

That's it for today, more tomorrow!

> For this timetable project I won't be copying the whole codebase into this repo every time I work on it, instead I'll just [link to the repo](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app) and even link [direct to the commit here](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app/commit/4b8a7c77649ffdab2ef117023eea8f9f00152e83) if someone wants to go have a look at that point in time.
