# Django - Part 1
Welcome to **day 8** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Ok, it's been one week, and so far everything has been python, not by design, but i'm most comfortable with it currently. I do want to get to the point of being able to make an app that isn't CLI, so I have started to have a look at some of the web frameworks for Python. After some looking around, I've settled on Django (I've tried flask before so wanted to try something new).

Like everything, it has a learning curve, but luckily, the devs have created a [tutorial series](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial01/) to go through, making a poll app. So while I don't have much to show for it, that's what I've been doing today, parts 1-4. Not particularly glamorous, but stay tuned for parts 5-8 (hopefully) tomorrow.
