# Next.js - Part 4
Welcome to **day 18** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Still battling some illness today, but still working through a few of the lessons in the Next.js [app router tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app). Today's focus was on error handling and data validation, something I need to be a bit better at thinking about in general.

Should just be one more day on this course and then I'll have to start thinking about using it for a project of my own.
