# SQLite - Running Not Walking
Welcome to **day 5** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Ok, yesterday I dipped my toe in the water of DB's and SQLite in Python, and it got me thinking. I have another goal this year, running the equivalent of 1km per day for the year (see the theme...?). Anyway, I need something to help track this, I need to see I'm achieving to keep myself motivated and honest with it.

So voila - an app to help me track my running progress. It gives some stats upon boot, and then gives you the option to change you goal, see your stats again (either to bask in the glory or berate yourself), and, vitally, ***add a run***.

A bit of an extension on yesterday, quite a bit more code to get the job done, and a todo list of stuff to work on:
- Data validation - I think this will have to be something I start doing better soon
- I'd like to be able to see a list of all of my runs, maybe filtered by month or at least sorted
- A GUI so that I can get it out of the command line, maybe web based so I can update it from my phone instead of having to do it on my laptop

Anyway, those are all things for another day, not part of the MVP as it were.

Not much to do if you want to try it for yourself, just run the py file locally, it will set up the DB the first time around and ask you to set a goal up front.
