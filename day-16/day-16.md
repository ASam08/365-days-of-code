# Next.js - Part 2
Welcome to **day 16** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

I didn't have much time today, but I did manage to continue with a few more lessons in the Next.js [app router tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app), Working through skeleton layouts, rendering options etc.

Not much to talk about today but tomorrow is another day...
