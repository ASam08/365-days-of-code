# SQLite - Building Blocks
Welcome to **day 4** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Time to get away from API's for a day, and delve into databases. I've used DB's before, written SQL queries etc. but have never written any code that used it's own DB. I know SQLite is not that involved, but learning how to interact with it via python, make sure it's built etc. was a cool learning opportunity for me, and probably unlocks a few more projects that I've steered clear of because you ~~can't~~ can but *shouldn't* just use a csv file...

Anyway, a bit of a simple example, but today I've put together an app that runs in the command line and lets you track your lego sets, with the name and set ID. Nothing fancy, no option to delete or edit (just don't make any mistakes in data entry ok?), and nothing like pulling the data (name, series, piece count etc.) from some lego API source with just the set ID - good idea for a future day!

Nothing you need to do to replicate, except run the code locally.
