# Docker - Nearly There
Welcome to **day 36** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Well today started with all of the best intentions, dockerize the app, winner winner chicken dinner. Unfortunately it's not quite there...

I have got the app up and running, it loads, but the timetable page won't load. I know the issue is that something is not quite happy with loading on that page without being able to find any timetable set, I just haven't been able to narrow it down quite yet. And after a busy day with non-code stuff, I just didn't have the time.

I did learn some lessons today, I found a bunch of issues with the code that running dev doesn't uncover, and so the big lesson is to always run it in prod before trying to dockerize it. I still didn't do this yet, but it probably would have been less painful than rebuilding the container each time I thought I'd found the last issue.

Anyway, I still pushed the commit for today, even with things not working properly, but it was to a different branch (first time doing that so another learning step for me).

More (hopefully the fix) tomorrow.

> For this timetable project I won't be copying the whole codebase into this repo every time I work on it, instead I'll just [link to the repo](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app) and even link [direct to the commit here](https://github.com/ASam08/timetable-app/commit/093119f19824cf224fc103222f6871f9c122aa95) if someone wants to go have a look at that point in time.

*2 days and no screenshots, what is this world coming to?*
