# Next.js - Part 5
Welcome to **day 19** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

I finally finished the Next.js [app router tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) today, rounding out with auth and metadata. Funnily enough it's gotten me thinking that auth is probably the first part of whatever I put together next with this new knowledge.

I do have a few ideas for what comes next now, watch this space...
