# Welcome 
Welcome to **day 1** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Starting with something simple today - Get the basic weather.
Using python and [WeatherAPI.com](weatherapi.com). No affiliation with them, just a google for free weather api's and it fit the bill for me.

To replicate, create a .env file with a WEATHER_API_KEY which you can get from signing up for free with [WeatherAPI.com](weatherapi.com).

Runs in the command line for now, maybe a goal for a future day to make a gui for it.
