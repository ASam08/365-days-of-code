# Next.js - Part 1
Welcome to **day 15** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

I really wanted to start looking at some front end web stuff, and I have had a little bit of a play with Next.js before, albeit not very successfully, so I wanted to go back to basics with it. Similar to what I did with Django on [day 8](../day-8/day-8.md) and [day 9](../day-9/day-9.md). Luckily Next.js have a bunch of tutorial content, so I kicked off their [app router tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app).

This is a cool tutorial, going through making an invoice dashboard, and I can see how powerful the framework can be, lessons 1-7 complete, and working on 8, but time to call it a day and work on the rest tomorrow.
