# Django - Part 2
Welcome to **day 9** of 365 days of code - coding every day for a year, little and often

Nothing too exciting today, just the completion of the [Django tutorial series](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial01/), making a poll app, parts 4-8. It's a fair bit to take in and comprehend, but I feel like I can start chipping away at putting something together with something I've written. Maybe not tomorrow though, I'd like to get back to producing something, so tune in again then folks...
